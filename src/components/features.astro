        "I worked alongside Mat for close to three years now. During this time, I have been really impressed by his level of knowledge in development. From front-end (HTML/CSS, Liquid, JavaScript, XML, jQuery) to the back-end (Gulp, Node.js, Shell, PHP), nothing is too complicated for him. Mat never stops learning and is always up to date with the latest trends. I learned a lot from him and I have only optimistic predictions for his career trajectory."
